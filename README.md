# PHP-practice
This is a self project on **basics of backend development**.
I have used PHP (PHP:Hypertext Preprocessor) to create a portal for students to enter their information. Basically ,It is a basic information collection 
portal for students.

# How to run the project:

1. Install XAMPP incase it is not installed in your computer.
2. Download the files from this repository and place it in the folder *htdocs* folder of *opt/lampp* directory.
3. Now open XAMPP appilication and start the apache web server (first) and followed by MYSQL Database(Second).
4. open the browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` and create a database for saving the students details.
4. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost/<folder-name>` 
5. Now the website is open in the browser. Try adding info ,updating and deleting the names.
